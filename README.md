Data Analysis Dashboard

This dashboard is created to analyze transaction data and customer reviews.

Project Description

This project aims to implement data exploration and analysis techniques using Python and libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. This dashboard helps in data visualization to get clearer insights.

Analysis Stages:

1. **Data Understanding** – Understand the structure and characteristics of the dataset.

2. **Data Cleaning** – Handle missing or invalid data.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Perform statistical analysis and data visualization.

4. **Dashboard Development** – Create an interactive dashboard for data analysis.

5. **Insight & Conclusion** – Summarize the analysis results to provide recommendations.

Technologies & Tools
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Streamlit / Dash for Dashboard
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

Setup Environment

Using Google Colab
Make sure all required libraries are installed. Run the following command in Colab:
```python
!pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Using Virtual Environment (Local)
Run the following command to create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
# Create and navigate to the project directory
mkdir project_dashboard
cd project_dashboard

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate # (Use venv\Scripts\activate on Windows)

# Install required libraries
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Running the Dashboard
Run the following command in the terminal to open the dashboard:
```bash
streamlit run dashboard.py
```
The dashboard will automatically open in your browser.

Customize to Your Needs
- **Google Colab** → Instantly install dependencies and run code in a notebook.
- **VSCode** → Use virtual environments to isolate dependencies.
- **Streamlit** → Run the dashboard locally in a browser.
